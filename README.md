# Script for generating Training and Test Cases for Malaria Modeling
This script generates a complete set of Training and Test cases. Number of data splits and Data Features are customizable.    

Usage:
=====

python generateTrainingAndTestSet.py [Number_of_splits] [CSV_File_Name] [feature_0, feature_1, feature_2....feature_3]

Here 
          (1) generateTrainingAndTestSet.py is the name of the script. 
          (2) [Number_of_splits] is the number of the splits of file(In our case 10). 
          (3) [CSV_File_Name] is the csv file that contains all the model Dataset. 
          (4) [feature_0..feature_1] are the serial numbers of the columns of the csv file you want to generate Test                   cases with(All this columns will be replaced by "*"). 

Example:
=======
python generateTrainingAndTestSet.py 10 model_dataSet_ex-3.csv 8 9 12 14 15 18 20 21 24

It will generate 10 case files in pairs(like (Train-1,Test-1),(Train-2,Test-2) and so on) in the same directory of the script file. The resulting Training and Test cases of the above command are saved in the Training-Test-Set/ directory of this repository.
