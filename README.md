# Script for generating Training and Test Cases for Malaria Modeling

Usage:
=====

python generateTrainingAndTestSet.py [Number_of_splits] [CSV_File_Name] [feature_0, feature_1, feature_2....feature_3]

=======
python generateTrainingAndTestSet.py 10 model_dataSet_ex-3.csv 8 9 12 14 15 18 20 21 24

The resulting Training and Test cases of the above command are saved in the Training-Test-Set/ directory of this
